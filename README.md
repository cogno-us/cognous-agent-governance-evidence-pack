# Cognous Governance Evidence Pack

**Turn traceable runtime records into reviewable governance evidence.**

## Overview

A reference format, validator, traceable importer and Markdown renderer for business-facing review of agent governance records. It preserves the relationship between a declared action surface and reconstructed runtime evidence instead of treating a summary as independent assurance.

**Implementation status:** this README describes merged public reference work. Component acceptance, selection in the hub and execution of a qualification are separate facts. The selected revision for this component is `de6b9e071df49fc3e0c1254d39b5c94cced554f0`; the [hub lock](https://github.com/cogno-us/cognous-open-control-stack/blob/5737267d94d2b445735c95e8480a31de73a2abe8/component-lock.json) is the source of that integration choice.

## Purpose and intended users

Enterprise reviewers need to understand authority, review posture, reliance, attempted actions and unresolved outcomes without reading every raw event. A useful summary must remain traceable and must not convert declarations or source assertions into verified operational facts.

Engineers can inspect the reference contracts and examples; enterprise architecture, security and governance reviewers can examine the boundary and evidence. Evaluate this component for its named responsibility rather than as a complete governance platform.

## Key features

| Capability | Implemented or specified responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Evidence structure** | Represent the agent, actions, governance context and source records in a review package. |
| **Traceable imports** | Transform Manifest and Reconstruction Bundle inputs with explicit source references and transformation versions. |
| **Assurance separation** | Distinguish declared controls, source-asserted runtime facts, executed tests and independent verification. |
| **Continuity checks** | Validate source identities, commitments and producer compatibility across the selected generation. |
| **Business rendering** | Validate, summarize and render Markdown for a reviewer while preserving unresolved and missing information. |

## How it works

The bounded refund produces retained reconstruction evidence. The importer combines it with the Manifest and records the derivation. A reviewer can follow each summarized decision or outcome back to its source and see the difference between historical authorization, current recovery denial and observed destination state.

A valid signature, chain inclusion, message receipt, reasoning instruction or evidence-package digest does not authorize execution. Institutional authority must be supplied and evaluated through the appropriate trusted boundary.

## Getting started

From a fresh repository checkout, use Python 3.11+ and an activated virtual environment. Install only into that environment. Package installation needs network access; the commands below exercise local reference tooling. For the full selected integration, use the [hub quickstart](https://github.com/cogno-us/cognous-open-control-stack/blob/main/docs/quickstart.md), whose runner supplies exact producer checkouts and test wiring.

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
agep validate examples/customer_service_agent_evidence_pack.json
agep summarize examples/customer_service_agent_evidence_pack.json
agep check-examples
```

## Evidence and supported scope

The hub selects `de6b9e071df49fc3e0c1254d39b5c94cced554f0`. Current persistence-generation transformation is **0.3.1**; previous selected producer-2.0.0 transformation **0.3.0** and historical **0.2.6** remain separately tested. Imported pack schema remains **0.2.0**. See the [persistence checkpoint](docs/workstreams/evidence-pack-control-plane-store-checkpoint.md); older migration notes describe their original generation.

The accepted [hub persistence-generation evidence](https://github.com/cogno-us/cognous-open-control-stack/blob/5737267d94d2b445735c95e8480a31de73a2abe8/examples/control-plane-store-adoption/qualification-summary.json) records 915 Python tests in each of two repetitions, 35 matrix entries satisfying their gates and 120 separate mocked OpenShell tests. Those are aggregate hub results, not a per-component test count or a claim of production readiness. Optional behavioral layers receive static checks only. The [support ledger](https://github.com/cogno-us/cognous-open-control-stack/blob/main/docs/release-status.md) separates implementation, execution and adoption.

## Limitations and deployment decisions

Import success does not establish that a test ran, that an institution authorized current reliance or that a control is effective in production. This is not certification, legal advice, independent audit or a runtime enforcement layer. Historical transformation outputs remain attributed to their original sources.

Review original artifacts and their exact source revisions before extending a claim to a new environment. New dependencies, authority sources, destinations or enforcement mechanisms need their own compatibility and qualification. A passing reference case is not a certification of an enterprise deployment.

## Repository guide

Use these sources for details; their historical checkpoints retain the status and scope of the work they recorded:

- [docs/traceable_imports.md](docs/traceable_imports.md)
- [docs/producer-v2-migration.md](docs/producer-v2-migration.md)
- [docs/validation.md](docs/validation.md)
- [docs/rendering.md](docs/rendering.md)

For a nontechnical introduction, read the [business overview](collateral/business-collateral.md) and [one-page overview](collateral/one-page-overview.md). Both describe this component's role and evidence limits, not additional runtime features.

## Contributing and attribution

[Contribution guidance](CONTRIBUTING.md) describes review and validation expectations. Keep evidence-linked claims, preserve historical records and separate proposed features from accepted implementation.

## Repository locations

See the [repository rename map and compatibility notes](https://github.com/cogno-us/cognous-open-control-stack/blob/main/docs/repository-renames.md) for current component URLs. Existing package names, schema identifiers and retained producer identities are unchanged.

## Merged producer compatibility

The exact merged Control Plane/executor pair has a versioned `agep-manifest-reconstruction-import/0.3.2` consumer mapping. See [qualification scope and pinned revisions](docs/merged-producer-compatibility.md). This covers the existing bounded export; atomic-claim and refund-intent evidence are not added.
